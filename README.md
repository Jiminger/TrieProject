# TrieProject
Java implementation of Trie Data Structure

This is a java implementation for a group research project on the trie data structure.
<br>
This specific implementation takes the complete text of the story "<i>'Twas the Night Before Christmas</i>" and converts it into a trie.
<br>
The user is then given a list of commands that can be used to further modify the trie.

Supported Operations:
<ul>
  <li>Insert</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
</ul>
